# Loan Approval Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on applicant details and credit history.

## Project Overview
Using a dataset of past loan applications, we:
- Explored and visualized key trends and missing values
- Built a predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Evaluated model accuracy and performance
- Shared findings and insights

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies:
